# A-simple-blog
This is my first project in Django (the other two web apps published here on my GitHub were made in Flask).

I intend to continue the study of Django and later publish more complex projects.

To set up the blog, I followed the steps of a video from the "Fabio Ruicci" channel on Youtube.
